    /// The sub-role is considered collapsible if it is identical to the main role with a trailing
    /// dash and number.
    ///
    /// For example:
    ///
    /// - The raw role string `Role` has no sub-role, and is therefore already collapsed.
    /// - The raw role string `Role.Role-1` is considered collapsible and would return
    ///   just the main `Role`, removing the sub-role.
    /// - The raw role string `Role.SubRole` is not considered collapsible since the sub-role is not
    ///   derived from the main role. The main and sub-role would be returned unchanged.
    ///
